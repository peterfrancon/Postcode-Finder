A Postcode can be entered in any case but requires a space in the middle e.g. Mk4 7nn. If a Postcode is found, the canvas will zoom to all corresponding UPRN's within the Postcode. A list of UPRN's within the postcode will display in the plugin dialog box. Double-clicking a UPRN will zoom the canvas to the chosen UPRN.
