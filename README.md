# Postcode-Finder
The plugin prompts the user to select the LLPG data layer from the Layers Panel and then enter a postcode. The plugin will search for the postcode, if found, the canvas will list all the UPRN's in the postcode and zoom to the points in the postcode. This plugin will be of use to Local Government GIS officers managing large LLPG files.
